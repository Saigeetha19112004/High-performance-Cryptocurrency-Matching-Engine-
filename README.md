# ‚ö° High-Performance Cryptocurrency Matching Engine

This project delivers a **Proof-of-Concept (POC)** for a **low-latency, high-throughput cryptocurrency exchange core**, designed around principles of **strict Price-Time Priority** and **architectural decoupling**.  
It ensures market fairness while integrating essential financial features, including a **Maker-Taker Fee Model** and **State Persistence**.

## 1. üß† Core Architectural Design

The engine utilizes a **Decoupled Asynchronous Architecture** (`asyncio`) to ensure **determinism** and **high throughput**.

| **Component** | **Role** | **Technical Rationale** |
|----------------|----------|--------------------------|
| **Matching Core** | `matching_engine_loop()` | ‚úÖ **Guaranteed Fairness:** Single-threaded loop eliminates race conditions and ensures strict FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order processing. |
| **I/O Layer** | Network Handling (WebSockets) | ‚öôÔ∏è **Asynchronous Concurrency:** Handles thousands of clients and broadcasts in real time without blocking the matching logic. |
| **ENGINE_QUEUE** | Communication Buffer | üß© **Backpressure Control:** Prevents flooding the single-threaded core with excessive external orders. |
| **Data Structures** | In-Memory State (`dict` + `collections.deque`) | ‚ö° **O(1)** time complexity for queue operations, ensuring Price-Time Priority. |

## 2. üßæ Compliance and Algorithm (REG NMS)

The core logic enforces **strict market rules** inspired by **Regulated Exchange Principles (REG NMS)**.

### üßÆ Matching Waterfall Algorithm

The `OrderBook.process_order()` function implements the *Matching Waterfall*:
- **Price Priority:** Iterates through sorted price keys (Best Price first).  
- **Time Priority:** Consumes orders from the front of each `PriceLevel`‚Äôs `deque` (FIFO).  
- **Internal Order Protection:** Prevents trade-throughs using:
  ```python
  if incoming_order.price < price:
      break
